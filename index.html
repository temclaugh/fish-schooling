        <h2>3D Boids</h2>
        <h5>Jo Booth and Tim McLaughlin</h5>
        <p>The boids algorithm describes the movement patterns exhibited by groups of animals with just a few simple rules. Groups such as schools of fish and flocks of birds have clusters of individuals (known as 'boids') whose velocity at a given moment is determined by the velocities of the boids surrounding them. This algorithm was created by <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/">Craig Reynolds</a> in 1986.</p>
        <h5>Constants</h5>
        <p>Two constants are defined at the beginning of the simulation. The first is the radius at which a boid is affected by flockmates. Intuitively, this reflects the fact that a boid has limited information about the flock and will not be influenced by boids that are far away. We call this the attraction radius. The second constant is the radius at which a boid will be repelled by others. This prevents collisions that might result from other rules of the algorithm. We call this the repulsion radius. Both of these constants can be adjusted to refine the movement patterns of the simulation, but the repulsion radius must be smaller than the attraction radius. In addition, Reynolds suggested an angle over which these radii would be considered. That is, a boid would not get any information from other boids that are behind its direction of movement. Because we were working in three dimensions, we did not consider this parameter in our simulation due to its complexity. We didn't feel that it would affect the steering behavior dramatically.</a>
        <h5>Steering Rules</h5>
        <p>For each boid <i>x</i> in the flock, we collect the set Y of all boids within the attraction radius and the set Z of all boids within the repulsion radius. We define three rules to calculate the velocity of a boid. The first rule is the alignment rule, which states that the velocity of <i>x</i> should point towards the average direction of boids in Y. This causes the flock to steer in roughly the same direction. The second rule is the cohesion rule, which states that the velocity of <i>x</i> should point towards the average location of boids in Y. The causes the flock to group together. The third and final rule is the separation rule, which states that the velocity of <i>x</i> should point away from the average location of boids in Z. As stated earlier, this prevents the boid from colliding and effectively forming a black hole.</p>
        <p>As a result of these rules, an initially random placement of boids will form clusters that behave as intended, and these clusters have the potential to merge into bigger clusters or collide and cause smaller clusters to break off.</p>
        <h5>Implementation</h5>
        <p>In our implementation of this algorithm, we applied these rules to a three dimensional simulation of planes in WebGL. We chose this framework due to its portability and promising future as a mainstream web-based rendering engine.</p>
        <p>To represent the positions of the boids in world space, a simple list would have required O(n<sup>2</sup>) time to calculate the next generation due to the cost of querying the nearest neighbors. Instead, we used a k-d tree to increase performance. A k-d tree is a data structure that, given any k-dimensional distance function, can find the nearest neighbor in an expected O(log n) time, depending on the distribution of the positions of the boids in space. This makes the process of calculating the next generation roughly O(n log n). We used <a href="https://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript">this</a> implementation of a k-d tree in JavaScript. The only operations we required were (1) constructing a tree given a list of points, and (2) finding all of the nearest neighbors of a point within a given distance (the two radii defined earlier).</p>
        <p>We used a library called <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a> as an interface to WebGL. The main difficulty we had was consolidating movement vectors with rotations and positions. Our algorithm used velocity vectors to describe the movement of boids with an implied upward orientation of the boids, but three.js only uses position and rotation and doesn't have a standard way of dealing with directional movement. Using some geometry, we were able to translate these vectors into the corresponding rotations and offsets that could be rendered by the library.</p>
        <p>In the main loop of the animation, our code calls a function nextGeneration(boids) which updates the velocities of each boid. In this function, we query the k-d tree to find all of the neighbors within the two previously defined radii of attraction and repulsion. Then, after applying the three rules, the final velocity becomes the sum of those three vectors and the boids initial velocity.</p>
        <p>To prevent flocks from moving out of the surrounding box, we added a simple mechanism to reverse the velocity of a boid if it got too close to the boundary. We aren't entirely confident that this reflects flocking behavior around barriers, but it seemed to work reasonably well. Another option we had was to treat the barriers as immovable boids that only contributed to the separation of the flock, but that resulted in erratic behavior of the boids when they got too close.</p>
        <h5>Usage and Controls</h5>
        <p>To change the type and number of the boids, add either "?birds_N" or "?planes_N" at the end of the URL, where N is the number of boids. Because the bird models have significantly fewer vertices than the plane models, many more of them can be rendered. While viewing the simulation, the camera rotates towards the offset of the mouse from the center of the canvas. To steer straight, put the mouse in the center of the screen. To steer in any direction, move the mouse towards that direction. The W, A, S, and D keys move the camera's position laterally, forwards, and backwards.</p>
